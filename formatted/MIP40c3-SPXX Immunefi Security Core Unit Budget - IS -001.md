## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SPXX adds the DAI budget for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security.

## Paragraph Summary

MIP40c3-SPXX adds the budget for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security. It contains:

* Total Budget Cap: The hard limit voted on by Governance
* First-month forecast: The actual first month estimated expenses
* Regular monthly forecast

## Specification

### Motivation

Based on the nature of the work done by the Immunefi Security Core Unit, the budget reflects the needs of the team to ensure continuity of the work described in our MIP39c2. This is summarized in, but not limited to:

* Identification of critical infrastructure and people
* Initial triaging service for the upcoming bug bounty program
* Incidence response set up and facilitation 
* Educational content creation around security
* General security advisory 
* On-call security advisory

### Core Unit ID

IS-001

###  Budget Implementation

The budget is designed with the following in mind:

* Operational costs to run the core unit and perform its tasks 
* Operational costs of third parties contracted
* Legal expenses
* Having a buffer for unexpected legal, technical, or financial problems

Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to:

* Funding an initial 6 month budget for IS-001
* A continuous funding model based on the [SES top-up mechanism](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp10-modify-core-unit-budget-ses-001/7369)

### Budget Details:

Providing additional detail with regards to the above line items:


#### Facilitator

Though listed as an individual, the compensation will be provided directly to Immunefi, pending MIP41c4-SPXX. All costs are only inclusive of all work done by the Facilitator. The quote provided assumes the maximum amount of hours, on a yearly basis, but has been evenly distributed per month.

#### Deputy Facilitator

The Deputy Facilitator will work a minimum of 24 hours per week, increasing the number of hours as necessary as well as having a planned increase to a full-time role as the Core Unit progresses. Like the Facilitator, all costs are only inclusive of all work done by the Deputy Facilitator.

#### Immunefi - https://immunefi.com 

In addition to the contributions of the Facilitator, Immunefi will also provide professional services including, but not limited to:

* Initial triaging of bug reports
* Content creation
   * Postmortems
   * General ecosystem security content
   * Core unit focused security content
* Security advisory services
   * Office hours support 
   * On-call security advisory
* Incidence response facilitation support

The provision of Operational Security Services will be covered under a separate budget proposal. 

#### ChainSecurity - https://chainsecurity.com 

The company, which provides software audits for the MakerDAO smart contracts, will provide final triaging services for smart contract bug reports as well as provide technical assistance during incident response. The quote provided is the maximum estimated amount required assuming a combination of regular working hours as well as emergency response hours. However, it is not expected that this would be used maximally each month.

#### DeFi Safety - https://defisafety.com 

The company, which provides security scoring for DeFi projects, as well as provides recommendations to projects to increase their security levels, will provide assistance with the identification of critical infrastructure and people and incident response preparedness. The monthly quote provided is a one-time fee for a set amount of hours for general work to be provided by DeFi safety as detailed in the Core Unit proposal which may extend beyond the first month if not consumed. The quarterly amount is including the first month of the set amount of hours purchased but with an additional batch of hours assuming that more will be needed. If more will not be needed, for any reason, it will not be required.

The company’s contribution to the Operational Security Services will be covered under a separate budget proposal. 

#### Software and Infrastructure Expenses

These expenses will include, but will not be strictly limited to, the setup and maintenance of:

* Secure communications channels for sensitive discussions
* General communications tools for office hours, general updates, etc. 
* Backups and/or primary hosting for identified critical infrastructure
* Internal organizational tools

These expenses will also include the provision of a premium testing environment for bug bounty hunters. 

#### Company Setup

Fees include all legal and administrative expenses for the creation and maintenance of the Immunefi Security Core Unit entity as a limited liability company for one year.

#### Monthly Budget Statement

Within the first 5 days of each month, we will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditors Wallet with the following sections:

* Budget Forecast – The amount of Dai that is required to maintain a 3-month runway for the team based on available information
* Previous Month Actuals – The actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended
* MKR Vesting Overview – A schedule of the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.
* Transaction Amounts
   * The required DAI amount for the Operational Wallet to replenish the 3-month runway
   * Any DAI amount exceeding the 3-month runway that will be returned to the Auditors Wallet.
The Monthly Budget Statements will be added to the MakerDAO forum. The originals can be found [here](https://github.com/makerdao-is/transparency-reporting).

#### Monthly Payment Flow
Once the Monthly Budget Statement has been delivered, the following payment flow will be executed: 

* Budget Statement Review
   * SES Accounting will review the monthly budget and check that its expenses reflect the allocated budgets in the budget MIP. 
   * SES Accounting may ask the IS team to clarify or correct the budget statement.
   * In case of disagreements, the payments will be paused, and SES Accounting will escalate to the Maker Community.

* Top up transaction
   * The auditors will pull the available amount from the DssVest contract.
   * Once the Auditor Wallet signers are satisfied with the monthly budget statement, a top-up transaction from the Auditor Wallet to the IS Operational Wallet will be made. 
   * The top-up amount will replenish the 3-month runway based on the forecast in the monthly budget statement.

* Return excess funds to protocol
      * After the top-up transaction has been completed, the Auditor Wallet signers will return any funds to the protocol that exceed 2x the monthly budget cap.

#### Transaction Amounts

The initial seed transaction covers the contingency buffers for the core unit:

 * Three months runway based on the forecast in the budget statement: 
 
 1.15 x $32 083.33 = $36 895.83 x 3 = $110 687.49

 * The non-monthly costs included in the budget: 
 
 $5 000 (one-time) + $61 500 (one-time) + $2 200 (yearly) = 1.15 x $68 700 = $79 005

 * Total:  $110 687.49 + $79 005 = $189 692.49

The streaming transaction covers ongoing activity for the core unit:

 * Monthly costs for 12 months plus annual corporate filing:
 
 $36 895.83 x 12 + 1.15 * $2 200 = $445 279.96
